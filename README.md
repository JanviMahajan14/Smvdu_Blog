# Smvdu_Blog
To read and to write,
To know and to be known,
Not among your fellow classmates,
But among the whole university.
We present you your very own university's blog site,

This blog will not only let you post your thoughts, images etc on the blog,
but will also provide you a specific section for sharing and downloading your notes;
so all the nerds and geeks are also welcome.
Apart from this, the website also provides you a chat option,
thus allowing you to connect to your classmates, juniors and even to your seniors for seeking help.
